# Client

This project is made in the context of a training course brief to create a client with Angular.

## Detailed context

This stage of the brief entirely focuses on creating a proof of concept client app for demonstration without having a proper backend API setup.
As such, exchanges with API will be simulated through the use of JSON data directly into the client and data won't be persisted in a database until the backend is created in a later brief.

As a proof of concept some part of the brief have been reworked to try out connecting a user to the backend API but most or the data remains simulated.

## Running in dev mode

Use the command "ng serve" to start the dev server then head to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## API

Part of this study project works in pair with the [backend Spring Boot API at this repo](https://github.com/g-broche/training-course-course-organizer-api)

## Project history
* Initially started as a proof of concept for an angular app for a first brief using simulated data through json files.
* Some part was then tweaked to try out connecting with a backend API for features related to auth with a user no longer being simulated but created by the API.
* State of project: Unfinished because we then switched to a third version of this brief's concept involving starting again from scratch...
