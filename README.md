# Client

This project is made in the context of a training course brief to create a client with Angular.

## Detailed context

This stage of the brief entirely focuses on creating a proof of concept client app for demonstration without having a proper backend API setup.
As such, exchanges with API will be simulated through the use of JSON data directly into the client and data won't be persisted in a database until the backend is created in a later brief.

## running in dev mode

Use the command "ng serve" to start the dev server then head to `http://localhost:4200/`.
